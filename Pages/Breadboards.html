	<h1>Breadboards</h1>
	<p>We connect battery or any other energy source to breadboard, and electricity flows through 2 first and last columns. There are many rows, called <strong>rails</strong>.</p>
	<p>When we use resistor or wire to give electricity to one hole in rail, the whole rail is having acces to this electricity.</p>
	<p>LEDs: use of LED should be done only with resistor in the same circuit to prevent the burn out. Longer leg is for positive charge and shorter - for negative.</p>
	<p>Important notes: do not plug LED or resistor both ends in the same rail</p>
