	<h1>IC</h1>
	<p>IC - Integrated circuits. It has 14 legs, 2 for power(7th is for negative and 14th for positive) and groups of 3: 2 input and 1 output.</p>
	<p>We start count of legs by placing the side with a small notch on the top. The first leg will be in the top left and the last one will be in te top right.</p>
	<p>There are different versions of ICs. Some have AND gates, others, for example - XOR.</p>
