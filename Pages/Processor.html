				<h1>Processor</h1>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined"><a href="../index.html">home</a></span>
			</div>
			<p>Processor is a computer's brain, executing software instructions.</p>
			<p>There are 4 main components in CPU:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Control Unit, who orchestrates operations, but doesn't perform any calculations.</li>
				<li>Arithmetic Logic Unit, who handles arithmetics and logical operations.</li>
				<li>Registers who act as a storage for instructions and data.</li>
				<li>Main Memory Unit who is used as a temporary storage for materials that CPU will be using.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Instruction Cycle</h1>
			<p>3 main stages: Fetch instructions from memory, decode them, and execte operation with storing results in registers</p>
			<img src="../Assets/cpuCycle.png" alt="stages of CPU cycle" width="400">
			<h1>Processor Speed</h1>
			<p>Processor speeds are measured in gigahertz (GHz) with modern CPUs operating at speed near 5GHz.</p>
			<p>Hertz is a clock cycle per second, meaning that 1GHz equals 1 billion cycles.</p>
			<h1>Multi-Core CPU</h1>
			<p>CPUs with multicores use 2+ cores(cpu) on a single chip, which enhances it's performance. Common variants are dual-core(2), quad-core(4), and up to hexadeca-core(16).</p>
			<h1>Cache</h1>
			<p>Cache is a fast memory for data that is going to be used by CPU.</p>
			<p>There are 3 levels of cache:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>L1, the fastest</li>
				<li>L2, medium</li>
				<li>L3, the biggest and slowest</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is also a LLC, last level cache, that is chared between all cores for data acess. The memory controller manages all data transfers between CPUs.</p>
			<h1>Pipelining</h1>
			<p>Pipelining is a technique when multiple instructions can be processed at the same time, which saves time and improves performace.</p>
			<h1>CPU cooling</h1>
			<p>CPU generates heat due to multiple processes running a the same time, and this factor requires cooling. There are several methods for cooling: air cooling, liquid cooling, passive cooling (heat sinks).</p>
			<h1>GPU</h1>
			<p>GPU is a specialized processor designed for work with graphics and paralle computations. Today they are used for renderin and work with AI.</p>
			<h1>Integrated vs Discrete</h1>
			<p>Integrated GPUs are built into CPU. They are cheaper but less effective. Discrete ones, on the other hand, are separate, offer more performance but mur expensive.</p>
