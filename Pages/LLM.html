	<h1>LLM</h1>
		<p>LLM - Large Language Models</p>
		<p>A language model is a machine learning model that aims to predict and generate plausible language. Autocomplete is a language model, for example. These models work by estimating the probability of a token or sequence of tokens occurring within a longer sequence of tokens.</p>
		<p>A difference between a LLM and a search engines is big. Search engines look for key words, they analyse websites and try to the most relevant result by the most key words. While LLM are able not only search, but solve problems. They also grow and have potential to become smarter and smarter.</p>
